# Vagrant and VirtualBox

Vagrant is a tool for provisioning and controlling VirtualBox images and instances. This section should probably be in the Appendix somewhere, for the ultimately curious on how to create their own VirtualBox images. As always, this is not meant to be a definitive guide, just the way I did it, and it worked for me, once upon a time.
