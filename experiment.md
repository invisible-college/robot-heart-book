# Experiment

This is an experimental chapter. It's primarily useful for people who are also trying to write books in Markdown and GitBook, and those people will probably want to look at the source code.

This chapter has multiple articles in it, which I'll practice linking to below. Here is an internal link to the [Chapter Table of Contents].
