For our special holiday workshop, we are going to try something a little more ambitious

1. Create a blank Activity.
1. Display a TextView that Says "Happy Holidays" or "Merry Christmas"
1. Display family pictures with ImageViews arranged on a RelativeLayout.
1. Draw lines between them in a family tree diagram.

Bonus stretch goal:

# Respond to a user click on an image by displaying that family member's name.
