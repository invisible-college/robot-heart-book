Java for Android
=======

This is the beginning of my book on Java for Android.
The guiding philosophy is one from CodeFellows: Learn more faster.

Based on my own experiences of Ruby on Rails. Rails is a popular web framework written in Ruby that is known for the ease with which one can deploy a backend.

There are a lot of intricacies of Java that you don't need to understand to learn Android or write useful apps. They are there if you enjoy thinking about them, but beginners don't need to learn them in order to get useful and interesting work done in Java.
