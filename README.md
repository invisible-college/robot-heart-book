Introduction
================

This is a book under heavy construction. If this were a website in the year 2000, there would be an animated gif with some hard hats and traffic cones. A lot of it will be experiments to remind myself how to use Markdown, GitBook,  I'll include links here to recent tutorials for the benefit of my proofreads and collaborators.

Childhood
---------

All my life, as I looked away to the stars, I dreamed of adventure
and computers. I wanted to take computers out into space, or bring the outer world into an inner world. And I wanted to write about it, in a way that would inspire others to take the leap and to remind myself what is beautiful about code and its children.

This book is a collection of tutorials, written in the style of a travel guide, addressed to my past self (or my future self after some kind of apocalypse). After I write it, all I will need is a time machine to go back seven years, give it to myself, save myself all kinds of effort and time, removing my need to ever write this book, and causing a time paradox. It's a small price to pay.

The book assumes a fairly technical background and aims to present things in a logical, ordered way so that later steps depend on previous steps. If I lose my memory due to some horrific science fiction disease that causes me to age years in a matter of days, and furthermore, I needed to recreate an Android app stat to save the universe, this is the book that I would need.



Based on my own experiences of Ruby on Rails. Rails is a popular web framework written in Ruby that is known for the ease with which one can deploy a backend.

There are a lot of intricacies of Java that you don't need to understand to learn Android or write useful apps. They are there if you enjoy thinking about them, but beginners don't need to learn them in order to get useful and interesting work done in Java.

==========

This book contains a lot of topics, interludes, and supposed tangents that are not part of a normal textbook.
